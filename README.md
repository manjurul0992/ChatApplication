#Title: "Real-Time Chat Application"
#Description:
The "Real-Time Chat Application" is a simple yet powerful real-time messaging platform built using Node.js and Socket.io. This application allows users to connect to a common chat room where they can exchange text messages and images with each other in real-time. Here are some key features and components of this chat application:

Real-Time Messaging: Users can join the chat room and start sending text messages instantly. When a new user joins the chat, everyone in the room receives a notification.

Image Sharing: Users can also share images with others in the chat. The application broadcasts the images to all connected users.

User Identification: Each user can set their own username when they join, making it easy for others to identify them in the chat.

Web-Based Interface: The application provides a web-based interface built with Express.js and serves an HTML file to users for chat interaction. The client-side interface includes the ability to input messages, set a username, and view incoming messages and images.

Server-Client Communication: The server and clients communicate in real-time using WebSocket technology provided by Socket.io. When a user sends a message or an image, the server relays it to all other connected clients.

Static File Serving: The application serves static files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) using Express.js, ensuring that the client-side interface is properly loaded.

This "Real-Time Chat Application" can be used for various purposes, such as team communication, social interaction, or as a starting point for building more complex chat applications. It demonstrates the power of Node.js and Socket.io for creating real-time, interactive web applications.
